For this assignment, I will use information from article "How to play: Blackjack" (also known as 
   Twenty-One in Cards games) from the website:
      http://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/
    
    The rules are simple, the play is thrilling, and there is opportunity for high strategy. 
    In fact, for the expert player who mathematically plays a perfect game and is able to count cards, 
    the odds are sometimes in that player's favor to win. For more please visit the above website.
    
    I will use the network graphical representation for the final "Pay Off" between player and dealer.

    The data is generated out of the basic strategy as shown in the next paragraph (Basic Strategy).
