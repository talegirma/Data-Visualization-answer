What we will see is:

    Random variables and Deterministic nodes are printed in ellipses.
    
    Deterministic nodes are defined by their parents and are not assigned prior distributions.
    
    Decision nodes are printed in rectangles. 
    
    Decision nodes are places where we can make changes in what happens in the structure of the network. 
    
    In this case, do we want to take another card from the dealer (a hit) or remain content with 
    the cards in hand?
    
    Utility nodes are deterministic nodes with no children that are usually of special interest. 
    
    In this case the utility node is the payoff from the game.
