   Yes. I used only a subset of the large possible dataset (based upon advanced logics).
    
    The subset data contains the information based upon the following strategy:
  
Basic Strategy
  Winning tactics in Blackjack require that the player play each hand in the optimum way, and 
  such strategy always takes into account what the dealer's upcard is. When the dealer's upcard 
  is a good one, a 7, 8, 9, 10-card, or ace for example, the player should not stop drawing until 
  a total of 17 or more is reached. When the dealer's upcard is a poor one, 4, 5, or 6, the player
  should stop drawing as soon as he gets a total of 12 or higher. The strategy here is never to 
  take a card if there is any chance of going bust. The desire with this poor holding is to let 
  the dealer hit and hopefully go over 21. Finally, when the dealer's up card is a fair one, 2 or 3,
  the player should stop with a total of 13 or higher.

  With a soft hand, the general strategy is to keep hitting until a total of at least 18 is reached.
  Thus, with an ace and a six (7 or 17), the player would not stop at 17, but would hit.

  The basic strategy for doubling down is as follows: 
  
  With a total of 11, the player should always double down. 
  With a total of 10, he should double down unless the dealer shows a ten-card or an ace. 
  With a total of 9, he should double down only if the dealer's card is fair or poor (2 through 6).

  For splitting, the player should always split a pair of aces or 8s; 
  identical ten-cards should not be split, and neither should a pair of 5s, 
  since two 5s are a total of 10, which can be used more effectively in doubling down. 
  A pair of 4s should not be split either, as a total of 8 is a good number to draw to. 
  Generally, 2s, 3s, or 7s can be split unless the dealer has an 8, 9, ten-card, or ace. 
  Finally, 6s should not be split unless the dealer's card is poor (2 through 6).
